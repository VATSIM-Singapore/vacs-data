## Contributing to the Dataset

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `vacs` dataset!

### Directory Structure

All dataset contributions must be placed in the correct directory:

```
dataset/{FIR}/
```

Where `{FIR}` is the two/four letter Flight Information Region code (e.g., `LO` for Austria, `EDMM` for Munich, etc.).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Files outside the correct directory structure will not be picked up by our validation and release process.

### Auto-Formatting

This repository uses [autofix.ci](https://autofix.ci) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to ensure consistent code formatting.

When you create a pull request, please **enable "Allow edits by maintainers"**. This allows the autofix.ci bot to automatically push formatting fixes to your PR branch.

#### Setting up local formatting (optional)

If you prefer to format files locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install dependencies (one-time)
npm install

# Format all dataset files
npm run format

# Check formatting without modifying
npm run format:check
```

If your editor supports Prettier, formatting can happen automatically on save. See our editor configuration in `.vscode/settings.json` for VS Code setup.

### New FIR Contributions

If you're contributing configuration for a **new FIR**:

1. Add your dataset files to `dataset/{FIR}/`
2. In your pull request description, include a brief paragraph about your affiliation to the FIR
3. After your first PR is merged, we'll add you to the `CODEOWNERS` file for that FIR
4. Future changes to your FIR will be routed to you for review

### Existing FIR Contributions

If you're contributing to an **existing FIR**:

- Your PR will be reviewed by the current CODEOWNER(s) for that FIR
- We'll wait for their feedback before merging

### Validation

All contributions are automatically validated for:

- Valid JSON/TOML syntax
- Proper formatting (via Prettier)
- Schema compliance (structure, required fields, data types)

If validation fails, you'll receive feedback in your pull request with specific error messages.
