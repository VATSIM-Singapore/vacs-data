# vacs Data Repository

This is the central data repository for [**vacs**](https://github.com/MorpheusXAUT/vacs), the **VATSIM ATC Communication System**. It contains the configuration data for Stations, Positions, and Profiles used by vacs to manage diverse ATC setups across the VATSIM network.

By separating configuration from the core application code, we allow FIRs to manage and update their own data independently and define their controllers' experience using vacs.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation on how to understand and contribute to this dataset is available in the **[Dataset Documentation](docs/dataset/README.md)**.

This includes guides for:

- [Stations](docs/dataset/stations.md)
- [Positions](docs/dataset/positions.md)
- [Profiles](docs/dataset/profiles.md)

## Tools

Because the dataset is large and complex, we provide a set of command-line tools to help maintain it. These tools can be used to validate the dataset against the schema and import data from other formats.

See the **[Tools Documentation](tools/README.md)** for more information.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from FIR staff and community members! Please refer to the [Dataset Documentation](docs/dataset/README.md) for detailed instructions on the file formats and directory structure.
